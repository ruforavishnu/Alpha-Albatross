Changes made: 

1. Created form form_AddTask in html view
2. On form submit, the control passes to form_validate.php
3. form_validate.php checks if $_POST['txt_TaskDescription'] has been set
4. If that is true, then the control proceeds to add a insert query to the database
5. Insert query succeeds. The input value , timestamp and related values are entered into the table tbl_task which is part of db_alpha-albatross
